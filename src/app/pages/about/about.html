            <p>
                I am a Junior Software Developer with a strong passion for creating innovative and efficient solutions. I am 23 years old 
                and have completed a three-year education in IT, combining academic studies with practical training at a company. 
                After completing my education, I gained six months of professional work experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have contributed to various projects utilizing a wide range of technologies, including C#, Angular, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, 
                and Python for AI development, data visualization, and Excel-based solutions. I am experienced in working with databases such as 
                SQL and Supabase, and in managing content management systems (CMS) like WordPress.
            </p>
            <p>
                For version control and collaboration, I regularly use GitHub and GitLab, as well as Jira and Confluence for structured documentation
                and project management. Additionally, I have foundational experience with web hosting platforms including Plesk, HostEurope, 
                SchlundTech, Azure, Netlify, and Vercel, and have gained initial hands-on experience working with Docker containers.
